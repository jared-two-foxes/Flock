## Server
  [] Game Mode - 2
    [] Enemies run from players, 
    [] Entities shrink over time?
    [] If an enemy intersects with a player that enemy is consumed by the player.  Player score goes up.  Players radius increases.
    [] Player dies when they run out of radius
    [] Last surviving player wins.
  
## Client
  [] Change the background to something more appealing
  [] Implemented ThreadedSocket which continuously polls and stores the most current message that its recieved only and returns that via a recv function.

## Dreams & Further Projects
  [] Implement a spectator mode.
