## Server
  [] Implement a reset/restart command.
  [] Enemies run from players, 
  [] Restrict to 4 players at a time.
  [] If an enemy intersects with a player that enemy is consumed by the player.  Player score goes up.  Players radius increases.
  [] Player dies when they run out of radius
  [] Last surviving player wins.
  
## Client
  
  [] Change the background to something more appealing
  [] Implemented ThreadedSocket which continuously polls and stores the most current message that its recieved only and returns that via a recv function.

## Dreams & Further Projects
  [] Implement a spectator mode.
